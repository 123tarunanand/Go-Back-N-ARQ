# Design:

The design stage of the project is planned to be divided into two stages.

### Stage 1:
* This stage is to be ready in time for evaluation of progress 1.
* The idea behind this stage is to complete the code and simulation of the Go Back N ARQ Protocol
* Implementing this stage is going to give us experience and help us learn NS2 better, in time for the second stage.
* After crossing submission of progress 1 decided to switch to Matlab due to insufficient mathematical simulation capabilities in NS-2.
* Implementation of the protocol in matlab was taken up
* Sample Go Back N protocol implemented in matlab with flow control and error control capabilities and dynamic channel noise generation.
* Plotting of sender and receiver side windows implemented.


### Stage 2:
* This stage is going to mark the completion of the Mini Project.
* At the end of this stage the theoretical simulations along with all the associated code will be completed.
* The aim of the paper selected was to find a better theoretical formula to better represent throughput efficiency .
* We started off by implementing a basic Markov model to represent the noise in the channel, which helps in better representing burst errors.
* A better and more complicated Markov model was implemented to improve simulation quality.
* Throughput efficiency of protocol simulating non Markov Channels and protocol using Markov Channels were compared.
