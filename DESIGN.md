# Design:

The design stage of the project is planned to be divided into two stages.

### Stage 1:
* This stage is to be ready in time for evaluation of progress 1.
* The idea behind this stage is to complete the code and simulation of the Go Back N ARQ Protocol
* Implementing this stage is going to give us experience and help us learn NS2 better, in time for the second stage.
* After crossing submission of progress 1 decided to switch to matlab


### Stage 2:
* This stage is going to mark the completion of the Mini Project.
* At the end of this stage the theoretical simulations along with all the associated code will be completed.
* The aim of this stage is to find a better formula to describe throughput efficiency.
